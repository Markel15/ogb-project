# Graph Neural Networks for Graph Classification on OGBG-PPA

This repository contains a collection of graph neural network (GNN) models implemented and evaluated for graph classification tasks using the [OGBG-PPA dataset](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/graphprop/). The work explores and compares various architectures such as GCN and GIN, applying different pooling and aggregation strategies.

## üì¶ Models Implemented

All models are built using PyTorch Geometric. Each model can be configured with a wide variety of training parameters.

- **Baseline** (Optional model without graph neural network architecture to compare )
- **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)**
- **Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN)**
- **Custom configurations**:
  - Number of layers
  - Node representation dimensionality
  - Aggregation method (`sum`, `mean`, `max`, `add`)
  - Dropout rate
  - Use of batch normalization
  - Use of residual connections
  - Pooling method (`mean`, `add`, `max`, `top-k`, etc.)

## üîß Training Techniques

- **Batch Normalization**: optional, improves training stability
- **Residual Connections**: optional, helps deeper networks
- **Dropout**: configurable dropout ratio

## üìä Best Results (Summary)

The models were evaluated using the standarized evaluator from the package.

| Model     | Layers | Dim | Pooling | Batch Norm | Residual | LR     | Dropout | Epsilon | Val Acc. | Test Acc. | Epochs | Time (GPU)    |
|-----------|--------|-----|---------|------------|----------|--------|---------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Baseline  | 3      | 128 | mean    | ‚ùå         | ‚ùå       | 0.001  | 0.2     | -       | ~11.9%   | ~13.3%    | 25     | 30 min   |
| GCN       | 5      | 300 | mean    | ‚úÖ         | ‚ùå       | 0.001  | 0.2     | -       | ~61.5%   | ~65.3%    | 60     | 4h 44min |
| GIN       | 4      | 200 | mean    | ‚úÖ         | ‚ùå       | 0.001  | 0.2     | 0.01    | ~68.2%   | ~73.1%    | 60     | 3h 24min |

The reported training times were obtained using:

- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 (with CUDA)
- **CPU**: Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7-10700K @ 3.80GHz
- **RAM**: 32 GB DDR4 3200 MHz

### üìà Test Accuracy (Mean ¬± Standard Deviation)

To account for variability between runs, the following results are reported as the mean ¬± standard deviation of test accuracy over multiple executions:

| Model    | Test Accuracy (Mean ¬± Std) |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| GCN      | 64.29 ¬± 0.002 %              |
| GIN      | 72.23 ¬± 0.007 %              |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.10  
- CUDA 12.4 (optional, for GPU support)

---

### 1. **Clone the repository (if you don‚Äôt have it already):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Markel15/ogb-project.git
```
```bash
cd ogb-project/src
```
### 2. Create a virtual environment (Python 3.10):
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
### 3. Activate the virtual environment:
- Windows:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
- Linux / macOS:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
### 4. Upgrade pip inside the virtual environment:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
### 5. Install PyTorch with CUDA 12.4:
```bash
pip install torch==2.5.1+cu124 torchvision==0.20.1+cu124 torchaudio==2.5.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```
### 6. Install the remaining project dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps
```

## Use example:
```bash
python main.py --model gin --layers 4 --hidden_dim 200 --epochs 60 --eps 0.01 --batch_norm
```
